## General description.

This project was developed with a template that has all the functionality to develop a project and is based on the [MIU](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/overview/) library. Many of the dependencies are not really needed but are ready to use.

This project fetches a free API where a list of users is obtained, each of which has a list of posts.
